# The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. 
# This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

#The document object is our html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. 
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
 
What does this really mean? 
to make it in to simple, if we want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.
property which is also available in short as document.property.

in simple,the document gets loaded in to window object which gives window.document{property}.

window.document.getElementById("header");
document.getElementById("header");
 both are same
